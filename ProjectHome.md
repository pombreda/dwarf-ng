## -- a little and powerful object file manipulation tool. ##

**dwarf-ng** is a powerful object file manipulation tools in the spirit of gdb. with dwarf-ng you can read and edit all the file's section headers as well as the raw data. With  dwarf-ng you  can create and customize new file's header and it can be used as a compiler back-end to create executables/object files. dwarf-ng also permits to  inject  easily  new  headers  and pieces  of  code/data  into the file.  dwarf-ng currently handles
  * Raw
  * ELF (Elf32, Elf64),
  * PE (Portable executables PE32, PE+) and
  * Mach-O (os x executables 32&64bit)
files format. In the future new files type will be added.
